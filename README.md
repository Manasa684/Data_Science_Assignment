# 📊 Data Science Assignment - Frailty and Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing two datasets to derive meaningful insights through data visualization and statistical analysis:

1. **Frailty and Grip Strength Analysis** - Examines the relationship between grip strength and frailty in individuals.
2. **Student Performance Analysis** - Explores how various demographic and academic factors affect student performance.

The objective is to use **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to clean, process, and visualize the data, making it easier to interpret and identify trends.

## 📊 Data Sources
This project uses two primary datasets:

1. **Frailty Data (`frailty_data.csv`)**
   - Contains **Height (inches)**, **Weight (lbs)**, **Age (years)**, **Grip Strength (kg)**, and **Frailty Status (Yes/No)**.
   - Used to study the correlation between grip strength and frailty.

2. **Student Performance Data (`StudentsPerformance.csv`)**
   - Features attributes like **Gender, Parental Education, Lunch Type, Test Preparation, and Exam Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)**.
   - Analyzes how different factors impact students’ academic performance.

Both datasets were processed and visualized to extract key insights.

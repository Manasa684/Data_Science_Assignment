# 📊 Data Science Assignment - Student Performance & Frailty Analysis

## 📁 Overview
This repository contains two major datasets:
1. **Frailty Analysis Dataset** - Examines the correlation between grip strength and frailty.
2. **Student Performance Dataset** - Analyzes factors affecting students' academic scores.

The goal of this project is to explore relationships within the data using various **visualization techniques**.

## 📌 Frailty Analysis

### 📄 **Dataset Description**
- **Height** (in inches)
- **Weight** (in pounds)
- **Age** (in years)
- **Grip Strength** (in kilograms)
- **Frailty** (Yes/No)

### 📊 **Visualizations & Insights**
1. **Boxplot: Grip Strength vs. Frailty**  
   - Helps identify differences in grip strength between frail and non-frail individuals.  
   - Visualizes median values and spread of data.

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Computes correlation between grip strength and frailty (converted to binary).  
   - Helps determine if lower grip strength is linked to frailty.

## 📌 Student Performance Analysis

### 📄 **Dataset Description**
This dataset consists of students' academic scores along with demographic and behavioral factors:
- **Gender**
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Parental Education Level**
- **Lunch Type (Standard / Free or Reduced)**
- **Test Preparation Course Completion**
- **Math, Reading, and Writing Scores**

### 📊 **Visualizations & Insights**
1. **Math Score Distribution (Histogram)**  
   - Shows overall distribution of math scores.
   - Helps detect skewness and outliers.

2. **Reading Score by Gender (Boxplot)**  
   - Compares reading performance between male and female students.
   - Highlights differences in score distribution.

3. **Writing Score by Lunch Type (Boxplot)**  
   - Analyzes whether students receiving free/reduced lunch perform differently from those with standard lunch.

4. **Math Score vs. Parental Education (Boxplot)**  
   - Investigates if students with parents having higher education perform better in math.

5. **Test Preparation Course Effect (Boxplot)**  
   - Compares scores of students who completed the test prep course vs. those who didn’t.
   - Helps determine the impact of preparation on academic success.

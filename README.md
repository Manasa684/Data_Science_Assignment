This version includes:
✔ **Introduction**  
✔ **Data Sources**  
✔ **Installation Instructions**  
✔ **Conclusion**

## 🏆 Introduction

This project explores two distinct datasets to analyze **frailty and grip strength** correlations and **student performance factors** affecting academic success. The analysis employs **data visualization techniques** to uncover trends and insights, making the findings more interpretable.

- **Frailty & Grip Strength Analysis**: Examines the relationship between grip strength and frailty in individuals.
- **Student Performance Analysis**: Investigates how demographics, parental education, and test preparation impact student scores.

This repository contains **datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and visualizations** to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

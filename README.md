# 📚 Data Science Assignment

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores two datasets:
1. **Frailty & Grip Strength Dataset** - Investigates the correlation between physical strength and frailty in individuals.
2. **Student Performance Dataset** - Analyzes factors affecting students' academic performance using various visualizations.

The goal is to **understand trends, correlations, and key insights** from both datasets using Python and data visualization techniques.

## 📊 Data Sources

### **1️⃣ Frailty & Grip Strength Dataset**
- **Attributes:** Height, Weight, Age, Grip Strength (kg), Frailty (Yes/No)
- **Objective:** Identify how grip strength correlates with frailty.

### **2️⃣ Student Performance Dataset**
- **Attributes:** Gender, Parental Education, Lunch Type, Test Preparation Course, Math, Reading, and Writing Scores.
- **Objective:** Examine factors influencing student academic performance.

## 📈 Data Visualizations & Insights

### **1️⃣ Math Scores Distribution**
📌 **Visualization Type:** Histogram  
🔍 **Insight:**  
- The histogram shows that most students score between **70-80 marks in math**.
- The distribution appears **normal**, indicating no extreme outliers.
- This suggests that math performance is **consistent** across students.

---

### **2️⃣ Reading Scores by Gender**
📌 **Visualization Type:** Boxplot  
🔍 **Insight:**  
- Female students tend to **score higher in reading** compared to male students.
- The **median score** for female students is **higher** than for male students.
- A few **outliers** indicate some students score significantly lower than average.

---

### **3️⃣ Writing Scores by Lunch Type**
📌 **Visualization Type:** Boxplot  
🔍 **Insight:**  
- Students who received **free/reduced lunch** generally scored **lower in writing**.
- Those with **standard lunch** had a **higher median writing score**.
- This suggests that **nutrition might impact academic performance**.

---

### **4️⃣ Math Scores by Parental Education Level**
📌 **Visualization Type:** Boxplot  
🔍 **Insight:**  
- Students whose parents have **higher education levels (Master’s, Bachelor's)** tend to **score higher in math**.
- Those whose parents have a **high school diploma** generally score **lower**.
- This suggests that **parental education plays a role in student performance**.

---

### **5️⃣ Test Preparation Course Impact**
📌 **Visualization Type:** Boxplot  
🔍 **Insight:**  
- Students who **completed the test preparation course** scored significantly **higher in math, reading, and writing**.
- This highlights the **positive impact of test preparation courses** on academic success.
